# nodemcu_websocket_android_homeautomation
In this project i have created a LAN based home automation system with node mcu and arduino, that device can be controlled using the android mobile application that is natively designed to run smoothly in any android base devices.
The file contains the proper conncetion between NodeMCU and Arduino nano using i2c protocol. The data can be feed using WebSocket protocol
to the NodeMcu directly.
